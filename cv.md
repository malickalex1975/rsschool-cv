## **About me** 
  I enjoy programming so much.  
My first experience started from Basic, Focal, Pascal many years ago.  
Then I tried coding for Android with Java. These days I am studying Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  
What about my dream?.. I would like to become a good programmer, to work on a friendly team   
and to create great applications.
